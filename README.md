NumPy is a computing package within python that allows the use of multiple array objects, tools and functions. NumPy contains useful algebra, code and generates random numbers.

The Numpy documentation can be sourced at https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.14.0/reference/routines.random.html


Simple Random Data and Permutations

Simple random data and permutation function in NumPy forms a part of the random sampling function (numpy.random). 

Numpyâ€™s random number function produces random numbers based on formations of a BitGenerator and arranges these. A generator uses these arrangements to fragment from different distributions. 






Name five distributions within the NumPy.random package

chisquare(df[, size])	Draw samples from a chi-square distribution.

logistic([loc, scale, size])	Draw samples from a logistic distribution.

geometric(p[, size])	Draw samples from the geometric distribution.

uniform([low, high, size])	Draw samples from a uniform distribution.

normal([loc, scale, size])	Draw random samples from a normal (Gaussian) distribution.




The use of seeds in generating pseudorandom numbers


The random.seed function in python returns the hidden generator of random numbers utilsed by python in the random component.
